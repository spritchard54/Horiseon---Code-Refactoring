# Horiseon - Code Refactoring

![Horiseon Code Refactor](./assets/images/readmeSS.png)


## Description
The files in this repo were refactored to meet best practices and standards in modern web development. HTML tags are descriptive, links are functional and the css file has been cleaned up by consolidating classes where possible. The code is clean, easy to read and contains no errors. Comments have been inserted into select locations to aid in future development. 

## Requirements
1. WHEN I view the source code
    - THEN I find semantic HTML elements
2. WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
    - THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
3. WHEN I view the image elements
    - THEN I find accessible alt attributes
4. WHEN I view the heading attributes
    - THEN they fall in sequential order
5. WHEN I view the title element
    - THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
